Coverage Gap Stage 7	During the Coverage Gap Stage, you (or others on your behalf) will pay no more than 25% of the price for generic drugs or 25% of the price (plus the dispensing fee) for brand name drugs, for any drug tier until the total amount you (or others on your behalf) have paid reaches $7,400 in year-to-date out-of-pocket costs. You may pay less if your plan has additional coverage in the gap. Always use your Medicare Advantage member ID card during the coverage gap to get the plan's discounted drug rates. The money you spend using your card counts toward your out-of-pocket costs.
Catastrophic Coverage Stage	After your total out-of-pocket costs reach $7,400, you will pay the greater of $4.15 copay for generic (including brand drugs treated as generic), and $10.35 copay for all other drugs, or 5% coinsurance.
